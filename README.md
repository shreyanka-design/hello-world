# A bit about me..

Hello, world!

I'm Shreyanka - a front-end dev who’s been writing code for a while and recently started exploring the design side of things, including writing copy. Basically, I’m morphing into a Developer + Designer combo.

This is my first GitHub project and my first commit.

More projects incoming - some fun, some functional, all me.
